## Notes

Durring build this app, I got an error when adding a tab bar for **Now Playing** and **Top Rated** movies. Thank @avo1 for helping me and recorded a video to show me how to debug: [https://www.useloom.com/share/e5ebd6f0f5ab11e6bca7777543759035](https://www.useloom.com/share/e5ebd6f0f5ab11e6bca7777543759035)
